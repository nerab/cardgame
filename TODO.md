* Extract the playing engine
* Finish the retry-mode after a player violated the rules
* Build a rules engine that enforces the game rules and prevents cheating (e.g. it must not be possible to add new cards to the deck)
* Implement swapping of cards when a zero was played
* Implement reverse order if Reverse card was played
* Can we detect the endless loop that occasionally occurs?
